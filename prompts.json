        "Q3:": "Wah, Macbeth is one sibei complicated play sia. Got so many themes like ambition, power, cruelty, and all that. Like the main guy Macbeth, he wanna be power like anything but then end up kena downfall, sibei jialat. Got the supernatural also, with the witches and their prophecies. Plus got the thing about how people act like they one thing but inside they totally different. Confirm kena chop my head to understand all these sia.",
        "A3": "Thank you for your input. Here’s my take on it:\n\nYour reflection:\nI learnt from Macbeth that if you got big ambition, you must also got some moral rules lah. The play talk about how Macbeth become powerful, but also how he suffer from guilt and how witches and magic make things worse. The play also talk about how people can be fake and you never know what they really want\n\nComments:\nThe reflection contains some elements of Singlish, but it may not accurately reflect the complexity of Macbeth and its themes. It also lacks clarity and may be difficult for non-Singlish speakers to understand.\n\nI hope the self-reflection exercise and feedback was useful in checking your understanding of the themes in Macbeth."

                "Q1": "What are the differences between covalent and ionic bonding?",
                "A1": "Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share electrons to form a stable bond. It typically occurs between nonmetals and produces molecules with low melting and boiling points. Ionic bonding involves the transfer of electrons between a metal and a nonmetal to form an ionic compound. The result is a crystal lattice structure with high melting and boiling points. Covalent bonds tend to be weaker and more flexible, while ionic bonds are stronger and more rigid. Additionally, covalent bonds can form multiple bonds, while ionic bonds are limited to one bond between each pair of atoms.\n\nRelated questions:\n1. How does the electronegativity difference between two atoms affect the type of bond that is formed between them?\n2.
